## This is a repo just to share my NeoVim setup which I currently use, I will try to update it if I make any major/minor changes :)

### If you wish to install this for your NeoVim

Simply clone this repo in your

```
cd ~/.config/nvim
```

and you are good to go, all the plugins will be installed on its own.

#### Feel free to suggest me any improvement on it :)
